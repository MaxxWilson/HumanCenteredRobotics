Hello.

Enclosed is HW3 for ASE 389 Human-Centered Robotics.

HW3_Submission.pdf is a write-up with equations, derivations, and plots for the DCM Trajectory Planner. The figures included in the report are also in the
"plots" folder and are generated from the provided plotting scripts.

File can be run from the hw3 folder with:
    python simulator/dcm_planner/main.py
    python simulator/dcm_planner/main_backwards.py

Plots are generated from the hw3 folder with:
    python plot/plot_dcm_trajectory.py
    python plot/plot_dcm_trajectory_backwards.py

I usually have to install matplotlib manually with "pip install matplotlib" when loading the conda environments. All code is working on my machine at the
time of submission.

Let me know if there are any troubles.

Thanks!
